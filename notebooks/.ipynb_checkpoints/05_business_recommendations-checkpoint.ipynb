    "# Customer Segmentation Analysis: Recommendations for iFood\n",
    "_Prepared by: Kiran Gosavi_\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Objective\n",
    "To analyze customer data, identify key behavioral patterns, and create distinct customer segments to inform a data-driven marketing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Findings\n",
    "* The customer base has a wide income range, with most customers falling into the mid-to-high income bracket.\n",
    "* Spending habits are highly correlated with income, and customers show a strong preference for high-value products like wine and meat.\n",
    "* Overall campaign response rates are low, but customers who respond tend to be high spenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Customer Segments\n",
    "Based on our K-Means analysis, we have identified three distinct segments:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Segment | Average Income | Average Total Spend | Key Characteristics |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Mid-Tier Family Shopper** (Cluster 0) | ~$58,745 | ~$685 | High purchase frequency, with a high number of children. |\n",
    "| **Low-Spender, Low-Engager** (Cluster 1) | ~$34,292 | ~$83 | Low income, low spending, and low engagement. |\n",
    "| **High-Value, High-Spender** (Cluster 2) | ~$76,366 | ~$1,351 | Highest income, highest spending, and few to no children. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. For the High-Value, High-Spender Segment**\n",
    "**Objective**: Retain and maximize the lifetime value of this segment.\n",
    "* **Product Focus**: Offer premium product bundles (e.g., exclusive wine selections, gourmet meat packages).\n",
    "* **Communication**: Use personalized, high-touch communication. Consider direct mail or private email invitations to exclusive events.\n",
    "* **Campaigns**: Offer special campaigns for a new product line with a discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. For the Mid-Tier Family Shopper Segment**\n",
    "**Objective**: Increase basket size and promote family-oriented products.\n",
    "* **Product Focus**: Promote meal kits, family-sized packs, and products with a lower price per unit.\n",
    "* **Communication**: Use targeted email campaigns with family-friendly recipes or deals.\n",
    "* **Campaigns**: Run \"buy one, get one free\" offers on products relevant to children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. For the Low-Spender, Low-Engager Segment**\n",
    "**Objective**: Increase engagement and drive initial purchases.\n",
    "* **Product Focus**: Focus on promoting special deals, discounts, and high-value-for-money products.\n",
    "* **Communication**: Use low-cost channels like SMS campaigns.\n",
    "* **Campaigns**: Offer a one-time, high-percentage discount on their first purchase to incentivize spending.\n"

    "### Predictive Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build a predictive model to identify customers most likely to respond to a new marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`MntTotal` (Total Amount Spent):** Our most significant predictor.\n",
    "* **`Age`:** Strong indicator of campaign response.\n",
    "* **`Kids`:** Highly influential on purchasing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model & Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model:** Logistic Regression\n",
    "* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n",
    "    * **Accuracy:** 87%\n",
    "    * **Precision:** 85%\n",
    "    * **Recall:** 78%\n",
    "    * **F1-Score:** 81%\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observation & Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Observation:** The model achieved a **Recall of 78%**, meaning it is highly effective at identifying customers who will actually respond to a campaign. This is crucial for not missing out on high-value leads.\n",
    "* **Recommendation:** Use the model to create a **\"Hot List\"** of the top-predicted responders. Focus your marketing budget on this targeted group to reduce costs and **increase campaign ROI by an estimated 20-30%** by avoiding mass-mailing to un-responsive customers."
